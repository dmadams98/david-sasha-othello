Sasha Bodrova :    - created the heuristic, changed and improved it until it was the most efficient; created the score calculation formula for the value of the possible move
				- score = ( ( ((amount of our stones after the move) - (amount of  their stones after the move)) - ((amount of our stones before the move) - (amount of  their stones before the move)) ) * (the value of the box where we make the move) ) 
			        - wrote this README file;

David Adams : 	- set up the git repository 
				- wrote the code for assignment 9 - 10
				- created 4-depth minmax algorithm
 				- wrote multitest.cpp, which runs the game 10 times
